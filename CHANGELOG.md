## version 1.0.1
* refactoring Cells, Items, Units, Containers, and Helper methods into separate folders (more or less emulating React component structure)
* starting to add AppContainer and other Containers, and experiment with rendering them to the HTML body (instead of declaring an explicit "game-window" div in the index.html file)


## version 1.0.0
* first published version of game, available on Heroku here: https://the-fire-mage.herokuapp.com/
